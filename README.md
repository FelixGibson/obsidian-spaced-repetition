This is a modified version of [obsidian-spaced-repetition](https://github.com/FelixGibson/obsidian-spaced-repetition) , and add some interesting features.

## Features

1. Multi-line style optimize: Allow the `?` symbol to be indented with space or `\t`

Now you can create a multi line card like this:

```txt
This is Question #tag
 ?
  - This is answer.
```

Be careful that the answer part has to have no less indent than the `?` line.

2. Multi-line style optimize: Allow you to nest unlimited cards
3. Allow to exclude specific tags in the settings
4. Hide cards number information so as to reduce anxiety ( I find this is useful when I have a large set of cards)
5. Allow a card can have multiple tags and can exist in multiple decks.
6. Sort the due cards by the time.
7. Allow the "Logseq" style tags, such as "#[[tags]]".
